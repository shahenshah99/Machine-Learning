# Machine-Learning
This repo of mine would be including multiple scripts written in python which would include machine learning as the back running algorithm. Note: I won't be utilizing any modules of python to do so the only modules I would be importing will have nothing to do with the machine learning algo, Hence if you are new to this field then it is a very good idea to read my scripts and learn the implementation of machine learning in real life for yourself. Please make sure to install all the python packages correctly, i.e If you use windows then make sure to add python interpreter to path and if you use Linux then it isn't a problem, eitherways make sure to install all the packages in their respective folders.
